| shell | Next.js 15 + Tailwind (tokens wired), routes, fake data layer (`lib/store.ts`, localStorage) | 2026-10-13 | done | | data layer keeps signatures for the later Postgres swap |
| engines | `engines/` pure TypeScript: grouped data, true paired sales, sensitivity, OLS, Theil-Sen, modeling | 2026-10-13 | partial | LAD, LMS, robust, modified quantile, adjusted pairs, depreciated cost, time-adjust fit | 9 unit tests pass: textbook examples (sensitivity $85, Theil-Sen $75, pairs) and a synthetic $50/sqft market |

| S04 | Datasets | 2026-10-13 | partial | property grid (S06), data source settings, dataset settings | generic CSV header aliases; needs a real HARMLS export to confirm. "Load sample" is synthetic |
| S05 | Subject modal | 2026-10-13 | partial | quality, effective age or depreciation percent, basement, half-story fields | |
| S09 | Results (Lot Size, GLA, Full Bath, Garage) | 2026-10-13 | partial | comments, export, prior choices, reorder, transactional settings, time adjustment, depreciated cost | the dot widget, constraint, snip, value input, Done, Lock, Model all work |
| design | `/design` primitives page | 2026-10-13 | done | | |

## Verification (real browser, Chromium, `next start`)
- Flow: start session -> load samples -> subject modal (Done disabled until address and GLA) -> results -> set GLA 45 -> Model on -> reload keeps the value.
- 0 console errors; no horizontal scroll at 390px; table view of results works.
- On synthetic data with a built-in GLA effect of $45/sqft, the GLA widget's methods land between $38 and $53 (Lot Size effect $1.20 lands between $0.6 and $3.2).

## Harder than expected / gaps
- **Not validated against your real sample.** I have your result numbers but not the MLS CSVs, so the engines cannot yet reproduce $43 (OLS), $39 (sensitivity), $85/$98 (paired). Send the two HARMLS export files (owner names removed) and I will add the acceptance test.
- Time adjustment (trend fit by contract date) and transactional filters are not built yet; prices are used as exported.
- Error scores use my own mean-absolute-error definition, close to the documented method but not guaranteed identical.
- Mobile: layout works but the limit sliders are cramped; revisit in design polish.
- Keyboard-only pass not yet done for the chart (sliders are native inputs and reachable).
